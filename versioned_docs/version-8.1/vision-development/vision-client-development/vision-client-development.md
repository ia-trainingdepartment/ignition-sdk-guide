The Vision Client has two main focuses when it comes to programming. Both center on communication with the Designer and Gateway, with the programming process being the same as the Designer. 

See the [Designer to Gateway Communication (RPC)](/docs/programming-for-the-designer/designer-to-gateway-communication-rpc.md) and [Gateway to Client communication (Push Notification)](/docs/programming-for-the-designer/gateway-to-client-communication-push-notification.md) sections for more information.
