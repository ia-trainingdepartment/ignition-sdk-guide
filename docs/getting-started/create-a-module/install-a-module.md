Installing a module you built with the Ignition SDK works the same way as installing any other third-party module.

1. On your Gateway, navigate to **Config > System > Modules**.
2. Click **Install or Upgrade a Module**.
3. Click **Choose File** and select the `.modl` file you want to install.
4. Click **Install**.

You can now launch the Designer and use your new module.
